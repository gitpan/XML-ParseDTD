XML::ParseDTD version 0.1.4
===========================

This module basically tells you which tags are known by the dtd, which
child tags a certain tag might have, which tags are defined as a empty
tags, which attributes a certain tag might have, which values are
allowed for a certain attribute, which attributes are required, which
attributes are fixed, which attributes have which default value ...
well i would say it tells you all that is defined in the dtd (at least
all that i know of, but i'm not so much into that topic, so please make
me aware if i missed something). All this information can be accessed
in 2 diffrent ways: 1. you can simply get it 2. you can pass certain
data and the module then tells you whether thats ok or not.

Internally the parsed DTD data is simply stored in 6 hash structures.
Because of this and because of the caching (with help of
Cache::Cache) the module should be very fast.

Please see the POD for additional information.
